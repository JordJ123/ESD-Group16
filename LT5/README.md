1. Document the Hardware Design (include a picture).<br />
   Hardware used: Color Sensor<br />
   This task was abit more challenging than the previous one because we had to deal with sharp turns an almost semi-circle turns. The speed of the robot played a huge role in this task, because sometimes the robot would make a turning faster than it should and the color sensor was not able to detect the white line of the path. So we had to play with the proportionality of the wheel spin(the turnings) and the speed. As I also mentioned before a drawback was the color or how the tape was placed on the floor
 
2. Develop the Software Design (by either a timed automaton or a statechart).

3. Develop the algorithm in pseudo-code (with clear association with elements in
   the software design).

   ```sql
   ```

4. Implement the algorithm in MicroPython (provide a well commented code
   listing). `lt5.py`

   ```python
   ```
